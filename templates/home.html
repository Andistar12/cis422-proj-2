                    <p class="mt-2">Organizing a family BBQ, a bicycle race, or any other social event? Need to send important information to your group/community?
                        tac is the place where you can do all that in a new and accessible way. tac works by giving individuals the ability to create and join boards, which represent communities they want to be a part of.
                        tac users can then make posts on the boards they are subscribed to, and upvote existing posts there. If a given post meets a certain threshold of upvotes, then everyone subscribed to that board receives
                        a push notification about the post.
